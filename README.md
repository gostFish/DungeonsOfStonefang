# DungeonsOfStonefang

This project had been developed for an assignment "Game Engines" in which a limited time was assigned to include as many game features as possible.

Game Features:

    Procedural level Generation
    Simple Character Selection
    Character Stats
    Turn based Gameplay
    Basic Enemy AI
    Player inventory
    Randomly generated Items with stat buffs
    MiniMap and fog of war

This Game is missing a large ammount of polish, including Animations and Post Processing, contains many evident bugs, and is an unfinished product.
This project is planned to be continued should Unity remain a viable Engine of choice once finishing academic obligations.
